# Enhanced Features for Loom Trading Bot

This document outlines the enhanced features that have been added to the Loom trading bot to improve its profitability, reliability, and multi-network support.

## 1. Price Oracle Integration

A robust price oracle system has been implemented to accurately calculate profits in multiple currencies:

- **Multi-Currency Profit Calculation**: Profits are now calculated in ETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC, WETH, and DAI
- **Network-Specific Token Addresses**: Correct token addresses are used for each supported network (Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon)
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If the price oracle fails, a fallback calculation is used to ensure profit reporting continues
- **USD Value Calculation**: Total profit is now also reported in USD value

## 2. Gas Optimization

Advanced gas optimization strategies have been implemented to improve transaction inclusion and profitability:

- **Dynamic Gas Pricing**: Gas prices are dynamically calculated based on network conditions
- **Network-Specific Gas Boost**: Each network has configurable gas boost percentages
- **Gas Price Caps**: Maximum gas prices are enforced to prevent overpaying for transactions
- **Gas Usage Tracking**: Gas usage is tracked and reported for optimization

## 3. MEV Protection

Protection against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks has been added:

- **Private Transactions**: Support for private transaction services to avoid frontrunning
- **MEV Blocker Integration**: Optional integration with MEV blocker services
- **Configurable Per Network**: MEV protection can be enabled/disabled per network

## 4. Multi-Network Support

The bot now fully supports multiple networks with network-specific configurations:

- **Base Network**: Optimized for Base Network with appropriate token addresses and gas settings
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Support for Ethereum mainnet with higher profit thresholds due to higher gas costs
- **Layer 2 Networks**: Support for Arbitrum and Optimism with lower profit thresholds
- **Polygon Network**: Support for Polygon with appropriate token addresses and higher gas boost

## 5. Configuration

A comprehensive configuration system allows fine-tuning of all parameters:

- **Network-Specific Configs**: Each network has its own configuration section
- **Profit Thresholds**: Minimum profit thresholds can be set per network
- **Capital Limits**: Maximum capital usage can be configured per network
- **Gas Settings**: Gas price, boost percentage, and maximum gas price can be set per network

## Usage

To use these enhanced features, use the provided `config-multi-network.toml` file as a template. This file includes configurations for all supported networks.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[backrun_strategy]
eoa = "0x6E3b634eBd2EbBffb41a49fA6edF6df6bFe8c0Ee" # Replace with your EOA
smart = true
chain_id = 8453 # Base Network
dynamic_capital = true
max_path_length = 4
private_tx_url = "https://api.blocknative.com/v1/transaction" # Example private tx service

# Network-specific configurations
[backrun_strategy.network_configs]
# Base Network configuration
[backrun_strategy.network_configs.base]
min_profit_wei = "1000000000000000" # 0.001 ETH
priority_fee = "100000000" # 0.1 Gwei
max_gas_price = "30000000000" # 30 Gwei
flash_loan_fee_bps = 30 # 0.3% flash loan fee
max_capital_usd = 100000 # $100,000 USD
private_tx_enabled = true
mev_blocker_enabled = true
gas_boost_percent = 15 # 15% gas boost
```

## Implementation Details

The enhanced features are implemented in the following files:

- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/price_oracle.rs`: Price oracle implementation
- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/profit_calculator.rs`: Multi-currency profit calculation
- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/backrun_config.rs`: Multi-network configuration
- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/state_change_arb_searcher.rs`: Gas optimization and MEV protection

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. **Real-Time Price Feeds**: Integration with Chainlink or other real-time price oracles
2. **Advanced MEV Protection**: More sophisticated MEV protection strategies
3. **Cross-Chain Arbitrage**: Arbitrage opportunities across different networks
4. **Machine Learning Optimization**: Using ML to predict the most profitable trades
5. **Automated Parameter Tuning**: Automatically adjust parameters based on historical performance# Enhanced Features for Loom Trading Bot
