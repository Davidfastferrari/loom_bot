# Enhanced Features for Loom Trading Bot

This document outlines the enhanced features that have been added to the Loom trading bot to improve its profitability, reliability, and multi-network support.

## 1. Multi-Currency Profit Calculation

The profit calculator has been enhanced to support multiple currencies and networks:

- **Network-Aware Profit Calculation**: Profits are calculated based on the current network (Base or Ethereum)
- **Multiple Currency Support**: Profits are now calculated in ETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC, WETH, and DAI
- **Network-Specific Token Addresses**: Correct token addresses are used for each supported network
- **USD Value Calculation**: Total profit is now also reported in USD value

## 2. Gas Optimization

Advanced gas optimization strategies have been implemented to improve transaction inclusion and profitability:

- **Dynamic Gas Pricing**: Gas prices are dynamically calculated based on network conditions
- **Configurable Gas Boost**: Gas prices can be boosted by a configurable percentage
- **Gas Price Caps**: Maximum gas prices are enforced to prevent overpaying for transactions
- **Gas Usage Tracking**: Gas usage is tracked and reported for optimization

## 3. MEV Protection

Protection against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks has been added:

- **Private Transactions**: Support for private transaction services to avoid frontrunning
- **MEV Blocker Integration**: Optional integration with MEV blocker services
- **Configurable Settings**: MEV protection can be enabled/disabled as needed

## 4. Multi-Network Support

The bot now supports multiple networks with network-specific configurations:

- **Base Network**: Optimized for Base Network with appropriate token addresses
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Support for Ethereum mainnet with appropriate token addresses
- **Chain ID Detection**: Automatic detection of the current network based on chain ID

## 5. Enhanced Configuration

A comprehensive configuration system allows fine-tuning of all parameters:

- **Network-Specific Settings**: Configure settings based on the target network
- **Profit Thresholds**: Set minimum profit thresholds for transaction execution
- **Gas Settings**: Configure gas price, boost percentage, and maximum gas price
- **MEV Protection Settings**: Enable/disable private transactions and MEV blocker

## Usage

To use these enhanced features, use the provided `config-multi-network-example.toml` file as a template.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[backrun_strategy]
eoa = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" # Replace with your EOA
smart = true
chain_id = 8453 # Base Network
dynamic_capital = true
max_path_length = 4
private_tx_url = "https://api.blocknative.com/v1/transaction" # Example private tx service

# Base Network configuration
[backrun_strategy.base_config]
min_profit_wei = "1000000000000000" # 0.001 ETH
priority_fee = "100000000" # 0.1 Gwei
max_gas_price = "30000000000" # 30 Gwei
flash_loan_fee_bps = 30 # 0.3% flash loan fee
max_capital_usd = 100000 # $100,000 USD
gas_boost_percent = 15 # 15% gas boost
private_tx_enabled = true
mev_blocker_enabled = true
```

## Implementation Details

The enhanced features are implemented in the following files:

- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/profit_calculator.rs`: Multi-currency profit calculation with network awareness
- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/backrun_config.rs`: Enhanced configuration with gas optimization and MEV protection
- `crates/strategy/backrun/src/state_change_arb_searcher.rs`: Gas optimization and MEV protection implementation

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. **Real-Time Price Feeds**: Integration with Chainlink or other real-time price oracles
2. **Advanced MEV Protection**: More sophisticated MEV protection strategies
3. **Cross-Chain Arbitrage**: Arbitrage opportunities across different networks
4. **Machine Learning Optimization**: Using ML to predict the most profitable trades
5. **Automated Parameter Tuning**: Automatically adjust parameters based on historical performance
